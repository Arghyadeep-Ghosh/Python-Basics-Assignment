        " iii) Large and Active Community: Python has a large, active community of developers who contribute to its ecosystem by creating libraries, frameworks, and tools.\n",
        " iv) Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python is cross-platform, meaning it can run on different operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, without requiring changes to the code. This makes it a flexible choice for development.\n",
        " v) Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language, which means code is executed line by line. This allows for quick testing and debugging, as developers can run code immediately without a separate compilation step.'''"
